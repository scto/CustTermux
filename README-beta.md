### 🚀 Usage

1. Install an IPTV player [currently supported for autostart]:
   - OTT Navigator
   - Televiso
   - Sparkle TV

   [Uninstall all Termux apps before proceeding: termux:boot, termux:tasker, etc.] [This fork uses "github-test keys".] 

2. Install the CustTermux APK from the [release page](https://github.com/siddharthsky/CustTermux/releases).

   [For example, use FireTV=armeabi-v7a. If you don't know the architecture, use "Universal".]

3. Open CustTermux.

4. It will automatically download the required files and ask you to select a default IPTV player.

   [In IPTV selector, You can select "none" to just run the server and use [SparkleTV2](https://github.com/siddharthsky/SparkleTV2-auto-service) to select any other IPTV player.]

5. In the end, it will redirect you to the login page. URL - [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)

6. Login via OTP.

7. Restart your device or force stop CustTermux.

8. Now, when you open CustTermux, it will start the server and automatically open the selected IPTV player.

9. In the IPTV player, add the playlist URL: `http://localhost:5001/playlist.m3u`

### ⚠️ Note

- Need to update Go binary / Need to change IPTV player / Termux issues / Having problems?
   - Clear App Data and rerun.

- If you are running the server on your phone and using it on TV:
   - In the initial setup, select "none" when asked to choose an IPTV player.
